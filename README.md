## Background

<p align="justify">Teachers need a system where they can perform administrative functions for their students. Teachers and students are identified by their email addresses.</p>

---

## Approach

In summary:

1. Create project structure â€“ models & controllers
2. Create typical CRUD routes
   - Students
   - Teachers
3. Create special routes
   - /api/register
   - /api/commonstudents
   - /api/suspend
   - /api/retrievefornotifications
4. Explore & connect to MySQL and ensure data is saved & persists for each route
5. Explore and include unit tests using Jest
6. Documentation

Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/christopherlye/nodejs-api-assessment.git
```

Step 2: Install npm dependencies

```
npm i
```

Step 3: Create a .env file

```

## Roadmap

### Ideas

- Validate the incoming data first before handling the request
- Explore using JEST for unit testing
- Explore using Sequelize over using mysql
- Explore Mocha & Chai
- Deepen knowledge of sql and backend in general
- Create seed data for user that automatically creates the database, tables and records

---

## TechStack

- nodeJS
- expressJS
- JavaScript
- mysql

---

## Support

### Known Issues / Feedback

- Request body is not thoroughly validated
- Possibility of having malicious entries submitted by the user
- Need to continue working on the sending of data to the mysql database
- Schema and table have to be created first by the user
- Code not yet refactored
